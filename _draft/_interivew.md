# Prepareing research internship for ML/AI forl

During my PhD, I applied several research scientist intern in industry, and want to share some of my reviews on how was it how did I prepare.

# preparing the r

Preparing the reserach interivew. From my experience, the research interview usually falls in the following two categories: 
    - (1st case): The interview may goes in a way like "oh, I saw one of your paper ~~ is really interesting. Can you please explain that paper?". Then I show a slide for 5 mins talk. For 5 mins, I emphasize (1) motivation (2) research question (3) previous literaure (4) noevlty (5) TL;DR main message to the community.
    - (2nd case): The interivew can also goes in a way like "Please choose any of those papers and explain me". Then I prepare a slide for 10~15mins talk. 
    - For all of the previous cases, i felt it is really important to be clear on what is the main message.


# Research interview review 

## Meta 
- I applied 
- Meta Research Scientist intern - core ML 
My meta interview was two-fold
- 1st interview: I interviewed with well-known RL. It seems it was really free

## Google

For 2025, I applied I first get a questionaire from recruiter.  My 1st and 2nd interview was really nice. 

    - 1st Interview:1st person was from goolgle recommendation team. We actually started interview not by introducing each other and just ran to the question. It was 45 mins, where first 25mins was about asking some formulatic questions, and 15mins about my behaviour questions and last 5 mins for random qnas. 
        - Formulative questions (25mins): Since my background was reinforcement learning, it was usually about testing RL basic knowlege. What is differenc between policy-based RL and value-based RL? which one is better in which cases and why? Also, if we want to deploy our agent to explore safely in the real world, then how can we train that? Also if I want to build a system to control the temperature not to go over the safe temperature, then who to train that agent and how to design the reward function? Is it good to provide a dense or sparse reward when you want to safegly train the agent -- any possiblit of reward hecking?
        - behaviour questions (15mins): how do I choose the research topic? also the interviewer was very curious about one of my paper, black swan. She hopes to explain what is the main message of that paper. 
        - For the first interview, I felt everything is really went well since for most of the answers, the interview thinks my answer is really interesting and insighful and want really dense and constructive-back and forth on clarifing and further improving my answers.
    - 2nd interview: 2nd person is a reearch scientist from the google deepmind. This person first explained me
