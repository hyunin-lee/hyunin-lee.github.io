Hi! my name is Hyunin Lee.

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley.  
I am interested in __devising reinforcement learning algorithms with solid theoretical backgrounds for real-world application__.    
I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Somayeh Sojoudi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/index.html), [Prof. Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/).

Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree from Seoul National University where I have worked on research projects within neuroscience and machine learning with [Prof.Yong-Lae Park](https://softrobotics.snu.ac.kr/) . 

Besides my research, I am interested in democratizing AI education. I cofound and currently advise [**Outta**](https://outta.ai/).
