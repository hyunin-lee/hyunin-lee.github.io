I am a Ph.D student at UC Berkeley. 

My research focus on Reinforcement learning, Optimization theory. 

I am fortunate to work with [Prof.Somayeh Sojoudi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/index.html), [Prof.Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/).

Prior to joining Berkeley, I worked with [Prof.Yong-Lae Park](https://softrobotics.snu.ac.kr/) in Seoul National University.

Beside my research, I am interested in AI education. I cofound and currently advise [Outta](https://outta.ai/).
