I am a first-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. 

My research focuses on ***Reinforcement learning***, ***Optimization theory***. 

I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Somayeh Sojoudi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/index.html), [Prof.Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/).

Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree from Seoul National University. During my undergraduate, I worked on research projects within neuroscience and machine learning with [Prof.Yong-Lae Park](https://softrobotics.snu.ac.kr/) . 

Besides my research, I am interested in AI education. I cofound and currently advise [***Outta***](https://outta.ai/).
