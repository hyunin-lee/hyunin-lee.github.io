### About
I am Hyunin Lee, a third-year M.S./Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley. I am interested in **developing reinforcement learning algorithms and exploring their key concepts**. I am fortunate to work with [Somayeh Sojoudi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/index.html). Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree from Seoul National University where I have worked on research projects within neuroscience and machine learning with [Yong-Lae Park](https://softrobotics.snu.ac.kr/). 

Besides my research, I am interested in AI education üìöüë©üèª‚Äçüíª. I cofound and currently advise [OUTTA](https://outta.ai/).


### Research questions
* Identifying Challenges Beyond Scaling: What fundamental problems remain unsolvable despite scaling up models and data?
* Human-World Problem Representation: How can we translate intangible challenges from human environments into tractable decision-making formulations?
