Hi! my name is Hyunin Lee.

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley.  
I am interested in __devising real-world reinforcement learning algorithms with solid theoretical backgrounds__.    
I am fortunate to work with [Prof. Somayeh Sojoudi](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sojoudi/index.html), [Prof. Javad Lavaei](https://lavaei.ieor.berkeley.edu/).

Prior to joining Berkeley, I received my B.S. degree from Seoul National University where I have worked on research projects within neuroscience and machine learning with [Prof.Yong-Lae Park](https://softrobotics.snu.ac.kr/). 

Besides my research, __I am interested in democratizing AI education :school:. I cofound and currently advise__ [**Outta**](https://outta.ai/) to provide equal educational opportunities for underprivileged students.
