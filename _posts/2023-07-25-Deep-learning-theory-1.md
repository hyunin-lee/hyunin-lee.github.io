# Chapter1. Pretraining
The chapter 1 can be grapsed as __Wide and Deep Neural Networks are goverend by nearly-Gaussian distributions__.


## Gaussian integrals. 
### single variable gaussian distribution
we define the Gaussian distributions with zero-mean with variance K as 
$$ p(z)= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi K}} e^{-z^2 / 2K}$$
